Description: Provides tools for simulating from spatial modeling of individual level  of infectious disease transmission when co-variates measured with error, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based model within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) compartmental frameworks.
